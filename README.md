<b>Hi,I am a talented programmer</b> who, apart from programming, is passionate about electronics, and robotics, cars, basketball, art in all forms, and history

Currently I'm expanding my knowledge of creating fullstack apps in <b>Angular and Nodejs with Express</b>
Mostly using MongoDb as dataBase, but I had contact with <b>MySQL</b> (used in one small <b>PHP</b> project)

Currently interested in history of The Great War, after seeing one meme about Gallipoli battle
